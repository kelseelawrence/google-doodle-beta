# My Topic Google Doodle

Earth Day is a global celebration of our planet's natural environment, held annually on April 22nd. It encourages individuals, communities, and governments to take action toward preserving the Earth through sustainability, reducing waste, and supporting eco-friendly practices. Each year, the world generates over 2.12 billion tons of waste, with a large percentage of it being plastic that pollutes our oceans and landfills. In the United States alone, more than 250 million tons of trash are produced annually. The older I have gotten, the more I have realized the importance of Earth Day and how important sustainability and being eco-friendly can be. 
This project tested my patience. I tried about 5o different SVG versions before settling on this one. I wanted there to be trash littered across the page and have it be draggable into the trash can to make it interactive. Learning the jsap draggable plugIn was almost the end of me but the moment my little pieces of trash were actually dragging, it was all worth it. I wasn't sure what to do with the rest of the animation so I tried multiple things and used AI to help me generate some ideas.
