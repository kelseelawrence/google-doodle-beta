# My Topic Google Doodle

Earth Day is a global celebration of our planet's natural environment, held annually on April 22nd. It encourages individuals, communities, and governments to take action toward preserving the Earth through sustainability, reducing waste, and supporting eco-friendly practices. Each year, the world generates over 2.12 billion tons of waste, with a large percentage of it being plastic that pollutes our oceans and landfills. In the United States alone, more than 250 million tons of trash are produced annually. Earth Day reminds us of the urgent need to reduce waste and recycle more to protect the environment for future generations, fostering a sense of shared responsibility for the planetâ€™s health.
